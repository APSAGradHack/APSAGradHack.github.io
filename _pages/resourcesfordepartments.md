## Making Your Department More Inclusive

Here is a compilation of suggestions of ideas to implement in your department to make the environment more welcoming and inclusive.  The list is inspired by activities and actions that actual departments are currently taking to improve diversity. Contact us if you have more ideas and successful plans!
 
1. Organize and sponsor an annual/bi-annual dinner with female/POC faculty and staff. This is a great way to build and strengthen a support net for female students.
2. Conduct graduate student climate surveys and share the results with faculty. Most of the time the time the roots of the problem are ignorance and unawareness: know the numbers to realize how spread discrimination and inequality is and how you might be contributing to it. There are multiple sources with standardized batteries of questions (e.g. cite, cite).
3. Organize a meeting (open to all) to discuss issues experienced by women/minorities over drinks/at someone's house. Set an agenda for issues to discuss beforehand to make it more productive.
4. Strengthen your efforts to recruit students from underrepresented groups: Participate in programs like the Institute for Recruitment of Teachers (https://www.andover.edu/about/outreach/irt) which helps students with applications and offers fee waivers., or the APSA programs like the Ralph Bunche Institute recruitment visit and the Minority Student Recruitment Program.
5.  Organize an introductory event for incoming student to give to ground both formal and informal rules, and make them known from the start by all.

## The Diversity Checklist

1. Ensure that resources and information for misconduct reporting are available, easily accessible and confidential. Some universities have resources to gather complaints and comments from students, which then are reported semesterly in faculty meetings. An outside facilitator from the Title IX office comes to the meeting to offer guidance and ease the conversation around the comments and complaints. There are other resources like Callisto to improve the reporting process of sexual misconduct.
2. Be cautious and aware when you talk about affirmative action with your students. Do not attribute their successes to affirmative action. It is great to hear "You're going to do great on the market!", it is annoying to hear "You're going to do great on the market because there’s a high demand for minorities!”
3. Do not appoint professors (especially assistant) and students from underrepresented groups to all the diversity, inclusion and mentorship activities/committees of your department. Most of them are highly motivated to do it, but their own work and research suffer from these extra efforts. Make sure to involve the whole department and redirect the efforts from "how to deal with discrimination and aggressions from your peers" to "how to behave in a way that you do not discriminate and enlarge inequalities".
4. When having faculty meetings about diversity issues, department climate, or more sensitive and specific issues like harassment, consider inviting a third party individual from outside of the department (possibly from Title IX office or the Dean of Diversity office) to serve as a more objective discussion facilitator.
