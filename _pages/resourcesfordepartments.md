## Ideas for Making Your Department More Inclusive 

Here is a compilation of ideas to implement in your department to make the environment more inclusive. The list is inspired by activities and actions some departments are already taking. Contact us if you have any more suggestions.
 
1. Ensure that resources and information for **misconduct reporting** are available, easily accessible, and confidential. Given fears about possible professional retaliation among others, students may not know to whom they can safely report instances of harassment or exclusion. Consider setting up a way to gather complaints and comments from students anonymously, which are then discussed in faculty meetings.

2. Conduct **graduate student climate surveys**, share the results, and discuss them in faculty meetings. Knowing the numbers will shed light on how widespread discrimination and inequality are in your department, and whether certain actions or policies are contributing to the problem. Linked below are some examples of climate surveys with standardized batteries of questions, and feel free to adapt our climate survey to your needs. 

3. Strengthen efforts to **recruit and retain** students from underrepresented backgrounds. Participate in and support programs such as: 

    * [The Institute for Recruitment of Teachers](https://www.andover.edu/about/outreach/irt) which helps students with applications and offers fee waivers.
    * [The Ralph Bunche Summer Institute](https://www.apsanet.org/rbsi-programinfo) which is an annual, intensive five-week program held at Duke University, designed to introduce to the world of doctoral study in political science those undergraduate students from under-represented racial and ethnic groups.
    * [The Minority Student Recruitment Program](https://www.apsanet.org/msrp) which identifies undergraduate students from underrepresented backgrounds who show potential for or are interested in doctoral study, and shares this recruitment information with APSA member graduate departments that enroll in the program.

    For more programs, please see [the APSA Diversity page](https://www.apsanet.org/diversityprograms).
