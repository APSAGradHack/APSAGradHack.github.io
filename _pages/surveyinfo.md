## The APSA Hackathon Survey for Graduate Student Diversity and Inclusion

A group of graduate students, led by Leah Rosenzweig and Yang-Yang Zhou, conducted the APSA Hackathon Survey for Graduate Student Diversity and Inclusion in the summer of 2018. 

As of August 31, 2018, the survey has received 426 respondents. While the survey was primarily intended for graduate students in political science departments, we also invited undergraduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty members to complete the survey.

If you would like to complete the survey, you can do so [here](https://mit.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0fepfJ9cDikYlmJ). We will perodically update this website with new survey results.

## Conduct a climate survey in your own department

If you are interested in using our survey as a template to design and conduct your own graduate student climate survey, you can view a copy of our survey in PDF format [here](https://github.com/APSAGradHack/dataresources/blob/master/APSA%20Hackathon%20Qualtrics%20Survey%20Script.pdf).
