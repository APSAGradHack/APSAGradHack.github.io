## APSA 2018 Diversity and Inclusion Hackathon

### What are the ways in which political science departments can create an inclusive and productive climate for all graduate students?

Description: Our work has been an attempt to brainstorm concrete actions that departments can take to enhance the graduate student experience,
 with specific consideration towards diversity and inclusion. The hope is that our conversation will allow students to share and discuss 
what different departments are currently doing to improve graduate student life in the department, both in and outside of the classroom. 
Our page presents the findings from the graduate student climate survey, resources that may help graduate students, and policy ideas to departments 
that look for ideas that could render the department more inclusive for graduate students and others.
