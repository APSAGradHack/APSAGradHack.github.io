## What are the ways in which political science departments can create an inclusive and productive climate for all graduate students?


At the 2018 American Political Science Association conference, our team of graduate students was a part of the [Hackathon](https://connect.apsanet.org/hackathon/) led by the APSA Presidential Task Force on Women's Advancement. We worked to brainstorm concrete actions that departments can take to enhance the graduate student experience, with specific consideration towards diversity and inclusion. 

Our goal is to share and discuss what different departments are currently doing to improve graduate student life in the department, both in and outside of the classroom. We have also conducted a climate survey of more than 400 current and recent graduate students from political science departments across the country. On this website, you will find results from this ongoing survey and resources for graduate students and departments to help improve issues of diversity and inclusion.   

This website is a work in progress so please check back regularly and contact us if you have any questions or suggestions.
